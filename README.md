# Kpop blogshop
KSS project practice
**Updated with new features**: Interactive Smart Shopping Cart

# What is it?
-Template of a blogshop
-You can clone it onto Cloud 9 workspace through its URL, and start doing the necessary editing to help you create one that you desire. 
-New Addition: An interactive smart shopping cart included so as to keep track of the purchased items. A very smart one as it will auto calculate and add on the Shopping cost while keeping updated on the number of Shopping Items selected by user. If user choose to delete items from the Shopping Cart, it will disappear once it reaches a 0 value.

# Suggested ideas
-Add in images, videos etc
-Add in more CSS elements (Look to BOOTSTRAP website for more help on the different components) 
-Add in payment gateway (such as Paypal...)
